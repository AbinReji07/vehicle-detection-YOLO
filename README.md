# vehicle-detection-YOLO
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect vehicles in real-time from video streams or images. It leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to identify and locate vehicles with bounding boxes, ensuring fast and accurate performance.
